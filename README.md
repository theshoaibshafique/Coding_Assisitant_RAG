# Coding Assistant RAG
This project leverages the power of multiple local language models (LLMs) using LlamaIndex and Ollama to create an intelligent agent capable of reading and generating code. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ§  How It Works
Our AI agent processes the provided documentation and code to understand the existing functionality. Using this knowledge, it generates new code snippets and functionalities, enhancing the existing project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
* Read and understand: The AI agent reads the provided documentation and codebase.
* Generate code: Based on the existing code, the agent generates new code snippets and features.
* Improve productivity: Streamline the coding process and boost productivity with AI-generated code.
